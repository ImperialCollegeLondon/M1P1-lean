Limits of sequences.

Part of the M1P1 Lean project.

This file contains the basic definition of the limit of a sequence, and
proves basic properties about it.

It is full of comments in an attempt to make it more comprehensible to
mathematicians with little Lean experience, although by far the best
way to understand what is going on is to open the file within Lean 3.4.2
so you can check out the goal at each line -- this really helps understanding.

-- The import below gives us a working copy of the real numbers ℝ,
-- and functions such as abs : ℝ → ℝ 
import data.real.basic

-- This import has addition of functions, which we need for sums of limits.
import algebra.pi_instances

-- This next import gives us several tactics of use to mathematicians:
-- (1) norm_num [to prove basic facts about reals like 2+2 = 4]
-- (2) ring [to prove basic algebra identities like (a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2]
-- (3) linarith [to prove basic inequalities like x > 0 -> x/2 > 0]
import tactic.linarith

-- These lines switch Lean into "maths proof mode" -- don't worry about them.
-- Basically they tell Lean to use the axiom of choice and the
-- law of the excluded middle, two standard maths facts which we
-- assume all the time in maths, usually without comment.
